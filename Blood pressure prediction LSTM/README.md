## üîç Overview

This project presents a hybrid AI solution that combines **LSTM Neural Networks** with **Generative AI** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to predict systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in patients. The model not only forecasts BP trends from historical data but also integrates **explainable AI (XAI)** and **GenAI-backed clinical insights** to support medical decision-making.

Key innovations include:
- **Time-series LSTM modeling** of vital signs  
- **Explainability using SHAP, attention layers**  
- **RAG-enhanced justifications** with medical literature  
- **GenAI chatbot interface** for clinician and patient interaction

## üß¨ Motivation

Hypertension is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease and early detection of spikes can save lives. However, most AI models used in clinical prediction are black-boxes. This project solves that by offering:

- Accurate blood pressure forecasting using LSTM  
- Transparent model reasoning via SHAP and attention  
- RAG-based insights from clinical documents (AHA, WHO)  
- GenAI chatbot assistant for explainable interactions
