## 🔍 Overview

This project investigates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict future blood pressure values in patients, with a strong emphasis on **explainability and transparency** in AI-driven healthcare systems.

The model aims to not only forecast blood pressure trends but also provide interpretable insights that medical professionals can trust and act upon. This approach integrates **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to increase clinical relevance and user trust.

## 🧬 Motivation

Hypertension is a silent but leading contributor to cardiovascular diseases worldwide. Predicting abnormal spikes in blood pressure enables proactive intervention. Traditional black-box AI models lack interpretability, which limits their adoption in clinical settings. This work addresses that by:

- Forecasting systolic and diastolic blood pressure using time-series data  
- Applying explainability methods (e.g., SHAP, Attention)  
- Enhancing trust in model predictions for clinical use

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- **Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Explainability**: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), Attention Layers  
- **Data Handling**: NumPy, Pandas  
- **Model Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
